# Introduction 
This case study was conducted as my capstone project for the 8th and final course of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** program 
to help students demonstrate the knowledge and skills gained during the whole course. I applied Google's procedures (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze,
Share, and Act) to my own findings and analysis which are displayed below along with visualizations.

# Scenario
The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded bike data and conduct analysis for Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, Illinois.
The director of marketing believes the company's primary path to success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships amongs it's customers. 
Cyclistic's finance analysts have found that annual member riders are much more profitable than casual riders. Therefore the marketing team is aimed at 
converting casual riders to annual memebers, but in order to do so, the marketing team needs better understanding on how annual members and casual riders 
differ and what can be done to maximize the conversion of casual riders into a membership.

# Business Task
As my business task, I was given the key question to answer: “How do member and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”

# Data Sources
The data has been provided by Motivate International Inc. under this *[license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)*. The data is a 
collection of 12 months of bike trip data starting from April 2021 to March 2022. The procedure for my subsequent analysis was conducted in R Studio since 
this program could efficiently help in data importing, combining, cleaning, filtering, analyzing and visualizing. Data for exploration can be found *[here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)*
